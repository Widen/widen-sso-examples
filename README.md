# Widen SSO Examples

We offer two standard methods of single sign-on (SSO) integration:

1. [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://community.widen.com/collective/s/article/How-do-I-configure-a-SAML-SSO)
2. [Simple One-Way SSO](https://community.widen.com/collective/s/article/How-do-I-configure-a-simple-one-way-SSO)

These SSO integrations can be used to make logging into the Widen Collective seamless; creating user accounts, authenticating users, and mapping user roles from IdP sources.

For more information, [see our community documentation](https://community.widen.com/collective/s/article/Is-there-an-SSO-integration).

## Simple One-Way SSO

Simple One-Way SSO is a quick and easy way to create an authentication request into the Widen Collective. The authentication request consists of fields used to identify the user attempting to authenticate along with a time-sensitive signature.

### Example Code Projects
* [Simple One-Way SSO (Java)](/widen-simple-one-way-sso-java)
