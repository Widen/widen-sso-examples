# Widen SSO Examples

We offer several standard methods of single sign-on (SSO) integration, including Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Google OpenID, and simple one-way post logins. SSO integrations can be used to make logging into the Widen Collective seamless and to create user accounts, authenticate users, and map user roles from internal databases.

For more information, [see our community documentation](https://community.widen.com/collective/s/article/Is-there-an-SSO-integration).

## Simple One-Way SSO
Simple One-Way SSO is a quick and easy way to create an authentication request into the Widen Collective. The authentication request consists of fields used to identify the user attempting to authenticate along with a time-sensitive signature.
