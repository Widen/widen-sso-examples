# Widen SSO Examples

We offer several standard methods of single sign-on (SSO) integration, including Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Google OpenID, and simple one-way post logins. SSO integrations can be used to make logging into the Widen Collective seamless and to create user accounts, authenticate users, and map user roles from internal databases.

For more information, [see our community documentation](https://community.widen.com/collective/s/article/Is-there-an-SSO-integration).
